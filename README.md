# Lumio Intellj IDEA Theme

Lumio is heavily inspired by the Kimbie Dark theme and has been expanded to include the whole IDE rather than just the editor. 
<br/><br/>

This dark theme uses a lot of warm browns and muted pastels for the main UI, saving the brighter & higher contrast colours for code highlighting in the editor. <br/>
The main design focus for this theme was creating something that was easy on the eyes - with fewer blues than many other dark themes. It's especially good for night-owl coders!
